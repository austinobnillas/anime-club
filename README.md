# AnimeClub  
### * In development *      

## Overview   
AnimbClub is a web app designed for the anime community. Here you may search up anime data and create lists of anime for your own use. Later, I hope to add functionality for public/private lists and user discussions on specific topics and/or anime.

This is my first application learning FastAPI Python Framework. This app uses data from the [JikanAPI](https://jikan.moe/) which is an unoffical MyAnimeList API with anime data. The backend for users and user based content is built is the FastAPI framework and MySQL database.
